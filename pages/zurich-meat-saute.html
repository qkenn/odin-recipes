          Originally called “Züri Gschnätzlets” (Zurich chopped) from the city
          of Zurich in Switzerland, this is a tasty and practical recipe from
          simple ingredients. You can use any kind of meat really, depending on
          your taste. Very traditionally, finely sliced liver and kidney is also
          mixed in with the meat and mushrooms.
